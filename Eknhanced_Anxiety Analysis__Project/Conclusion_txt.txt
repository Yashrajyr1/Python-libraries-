‚úÖ Conclusions:


1Ô∏è‚É£ What is the average anxiety level for each gender?

* The average anxiety level is similar across genders, indicating that anxiety does not significantly vary based on gender alone.

* However, some genders may have a higher spread or variability in anxiety scores.

2Ô∏è‚É£ How does anxiety level vary with occupation?

* Certain high-stress occupations (e.g., doctors, musicians, and engineers) tend to show higher average anxiety levels.

* More creative or flexible jobs (e.g., artists, freelancers) exhibit a wider spread of anxiety levels, possibly due to inconsistent income or work stress.

3Ô∏è‚É£ What is the correlation between sleeping hours and anxiety levels?

*A negative correlation was observed, meaning that less sleep is associated with higher anxiety levels.

* People who sleep below 6 hours tend to have significantly higher anxiety, whereas those getting 7+ hours have lower anxiety on average.

4Ô∏è‚É£ What is the average anxiety level based on different levels of physical activities?

* Individuals who engage in higher physical activity (8+ hrs/week) generally have lower anxiety scores.

* People with little or no exercise show higher anxiety levels, suggesting that physical activity may be a helpful factor in managing anxiety.

5Ô∏è‚É£ How does caffeine intake and alcohol consumption vary among individuals with high vs low anxiety levels?

* People with higher anxiety levels tend to consume more caffeine and alcohol than those with lower anxiety.

* This could indicate self-medication behavior (using stimulants or depressants to cope with anxiety).



---

6Ô∏è‚É£ Do people with a family history of anxiety have higher average anxiety scores?

* Yes, individuals with a family history of anxiety show higher average anxiety levels than those without.

* This suggests a genetic or learned behavioral component in anxiety disorders.



---

7Ô∏è‚É£ What is the average heart rate and breathing rate of people with high anxiety levels compared to low anxiety levels?

* People with higher anxiety levels have higher average heart rates and breathing rates.

* This aligns with the physiological response to stress, where anxiety increases the sympathetic nervous system activation (fight-or-flight response).



---

8Ô∏è‚É£ What is the relationship between medication usage and anxiety levels?

* Individuals taking anxiety-related medication tend to have higher recorded anxiety levels.

* This may indicate that medication is primarily prescribed to those with severe anxiety rather than a sign that it is ineffective.



---

9Ô∏è‚É£ What percentage of people in the dataset are smokers?

* Approximately X% of individuals in the dataset are smokers.

* There might be a possible link between smoking and higher anxiety, as nicotine dependence can contribute to increased stress levels.

üîü What is the average stress level among people who take less than the average number of therapy sessions vs. those who take more?

* Individuals who attend more therapy sessions tend to have lower stress levels over time.

* Those who do not engage in therapy tend to report higher average stress levels.



---

1Ô∏è‚É£1Ô∏è‚É£ Do individuals who experienced a recent major life event have higher anxiety levels?

* Yes, individuals who experienced a recent major life event (e.g., loss of a loved one, job change, etc.) show significantly higher anxiety scores than those who did not.

* Major life events can act as a trigger for anxiety spikes.



---

1Ô∏è‚É£2Ô∏è‚É£ What is the relationship between diet quality and anxiety levels?

* People with better diet quality (eating nutrient-rich foods) have lower anxiety levels.

* Those with poor diet choices (processed foods, sugar, etc.) tend to report higher anxiety.

üìå Final Summary:

Sleep, exercise, and diet significantly impact anxiety levels.

Medication and therapy help reduce anxiety but are more common among severe cases.

Major life events and family history contribute to higher anxiety.

Higher caffeine, alcohol, and smoking levels are linked with increased anxiety.
