🚕**Cab Ride Analysis - Project Overview**

⬇️⬇️
🎯In this project, we analyze cab ride data to uncover key insights into trends, demand fluctuations, and peak times etc.. 
  -By leveraging Python and data analysis techniques, we aim to identify patterns that influence ride experience and availability.

👉*Objectives:
Understand ride pricing variations across different locations and times.
Explore factors affecting surge pricing and demand spikes.
Analyze customer preferences and travel trends.

👉*Methodology:
Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Handling missing values, duplicates, and outliers.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing ride frequency, distance, and fare trends.
Statistical Insights: Identifying correlations between time, location, and pricing.

👉*Technologies Used:
Python (Pandas, NumPy)
Data Visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn)
Jupyter Notebook for interactive analysis

✨*This project provides valuable insights for both customers and ride-hailing companies by optimizing fare estimations and predicting peak demand times. 🚖📊
